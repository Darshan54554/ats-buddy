# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web UI Interface feature adds a user-friendly web application to the existing ATS Buddy system. This interface allows users to easily upload their resume PDFs, enter job descriptions, and view analysis reports directly in their browser without needing to interact with AWS services directly. The interface will follow a clean, minimalist design pattern and be built using modern web technologies (React/Vue or vanilla JavaScript with responsive CSS).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - File Upload Interface

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want to upload my resume PDF through a web interface, so that I can easily submit my document for analysis without technical knowledge of AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web application THEN the system SHALL display a clean file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a PDF file THEN the system SHALL validate it is a PDF format before upload
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid PDF THEN the system SHALL show upload progress and confirmation
4. IF the file is not a PDF or exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL store the file in S3 and return a unique file identifier (S3 key) for backend processing

### Requirement 2 - Job Description Input

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want to enter or paste a job description in the web interface, so that the system can analyze my resume against the specific role requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the job description section THEN the system SHALL provide a text area for input
2. WHEN a user enters job description text THEN the system SHALL validate minimum length requirements
3. WHEN job description is provided THEN the system SHALL accept and store it for analysis
4. IF job description is too short or empty THEN the system SHALL display validation messages
5. WHEN both resume and job description are provided THEN the system SHALL enable analysis submission

### Requirement 3 - Analysis Trigger and Status

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want to start the analysis process and see its progress, so that I know when my report will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both resume and job description are provided THEN the system SHALL display an "Analyze" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Analyze" THEN the system SHALL trigger the backend Lambda function
3. WHEN analysis starts THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with descriptive status messages ("Extracting text from PDF...", "Analyzing against job requirements...", "Generating report...")
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL automatically display the results
5. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL show error messages and retry options

### Requirement 4 - Report Display

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want to view my analysis report directly in the web interface, so that I can immediately see recommendations without downloading files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the formatted report inline
2. WHEN displaying the report THEN the system SHALL show missing keywords, skills gaps, and suggestions clearly
3. WHEN report is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to download as PDF or generate a secure, temporary shareable link (valid for 24 hours) to view the report
4. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show the compatibility score prominently
5. WHEN report is ready THEN the system SHALL allow users to start a new analysis

### Requirement 5 - Responsive Design and Usability

**User Story:** As a job candidate using various devices, I want the web interface to work well on desktop and mobile, so that I can use it anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured layout
2. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt to smaller screens
3. WHEN using the interface THEN all buttons and inputs SHALL be easily accessible
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages
