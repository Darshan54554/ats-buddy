# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Setup project structure and sample data





  - Create directory structure: lambda/, samples/, infra/
  - Add sample resume PDFs and job description text files for testing
  - Create basic README with project overview
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3_

- [x] 2. Implement S3 and Textract integration





  - Write Lambda function to handle S3 PDF uploads
  - Implement Textract client to extract text from PDF files
  - Add error handling for unsupported file formats and extraction failures
  - Test with sample resume PDF to verify text extraction works
  - Test error scenarios: password-protected PDF, corrupted file, non-PDF format
  - _Requirements: 1_

- [x] 3. Create Bedrock AI analysis functionality





  - Implement Bedrock client with Claude/Nova model integration
  - Write structured prompt for resume vs job description comparison
  - Parse Bedrock JSON response for missing keywords and suggestions
  - Test analysis with extracted resume text and sample job description
  - Test error scenarios: invalid API credentials, model unavailable, malformed response
  - _Requirements: 2_

- [x] 4. Build report generation and S3 storage





  - Create report generator that formats analysis results into Markdown/HTML
  - Implement S3 storage for generated reports with unique keys
  - Generate presigned URLs for report downloads
  - Test end-to-end flow: PDF → analysis → report → download link
  - _Requirements: 3_

- [x] 4.1. Review and iterate on report format


  - Generate sample reports and review readability and effectiveness
  - Adjust formatting, structure, or content based on sample output quality
  - Ensure reports are actionable and easy to understand for job candidates
  - _Requirements: 3_

- [x] 5. Create main Lambda handler and orchestration





  - Write main handler function that orchestrates the complete pipeline
  - Integrate all components: S3 upload → Textract → Bedrock → report generation
  - Add input validation and basic error handling with simple messages
  - Test complete workflow with sample data
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3_

- [x] 6. Add basic infrastructure and deployment






  - Create simple SAM template for Lambda function and S3 buckets
  - Configure IAM roles with necessary permissions for S3, Textract, Bedrock
  - Implement secure S3 bucket policies with proper access controls
  - Deploy and test in AWS environment
  - Verify all AWS services are properly connected
  - Test security: ensure buckets are private and presigned URLs work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3_

- [x] 7. Final testing and demo preparation





  - Test with multiple sample resumes and job descriptions
  - Verify report quality and accuracy of missing keywords/suggestions
  - Create demo script showing upload → analysis → report download
  - Document any known limitations or edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3_
